# Biomedical Signals Data Analysis
Here you'll find applied projects in signal processing, specifically focused on biomedical signals such as ECG, using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Objetives 

- Spectral & Time-Frequency Analysis
- Digital Filtering of ECG Signals
- Spectral Estimation with Window Functions
  
## Tools & Techniques

- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Fourier Transform-based estimators
- Custom amplitude estimation
- Window functions and spectral analysis
- Welch and Blackman-Tukey methods (to be explored in future extensions)


## Final Report

You can find a full summary of the results, analysis, and conclusions the .ipynb  files.
